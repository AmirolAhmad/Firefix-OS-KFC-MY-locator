				<h1>Colonel's Story</h1>
				<strong>KFC began with Colonel Harland Sanders.</strong> He discovered his penchant for cooking when he was only 9 years old. Through the years he grew up to become a personage the world knows as Colonel Sanders, founder of KFC.
				<p>He reached celebrity status in 1952, when he decided to franchise his famous Kentucky Fried Chicken recipe blends of 11 herbs and spices to the rest of America. By the early 70's, that special recipe reached Malaysia. </p>

				<h1>KFC Malaysia</h1>
				<strong>The first KFC restaurant was opened in 1973 on Jalan Tunku Abdul Rahman.</strong> Today there are more than 500 KFC Restaurants nationwide and still counting. Great tasting chicken has become synonymous with KFC; and has been enjoyed by Malaysians ever since. In fact, KFC Malaysia has developed a distinctive Malaysian personality of its own.

				<h4>Especially for Malaysians</h4>
				<p>We are an establishment that is run by Malaysians and managed by Malaysians; we took it upon ourselves to create a selection of food that would make Malaysia proud on the international scene. Kentucky Nuggets, for example, was conceived in Malaysia and then found its way to KFC worldwide. Today, Kentucky Nuggets is one of KFC's successes.</p>
				<p>"Meals on Wheels" was also developed in Malaysia. It was created for the purpose of bringing great tasting chicken to places where a KFC Restaurant might not be available. So, any offices or companies can hold functions at any place and anytime!</p>
				<p>All our achievements add to our Malaysian identity. But it has only been possible because you invited us to share your lives.</p>
				<h4>Just For Kids</h4>
				<p>Then we wanted something really special for our younger customers because they are integral part of our lives. So, the KFC Kids' Chicky Club was developed exclusively for kids. Even 'Chicky', KFC's mascot, takes an active interest in all the KFC Kids' Chicky Club activities.</p>
				<p>We wanted to give every child something they can look forward to as a treat every weekend or on any special occasion. We sincerely hope that their childhood will be filled with wonderful memories.</p>
