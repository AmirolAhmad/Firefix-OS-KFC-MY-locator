Firefox OS JomKFC
=========================

This is a sample app for Firefox OS, loosely based on Web apps, meant to act as a simple html for getting started with apps for Firefox OS.

It will get the data manually from [KFC Malaysia website](http://kfc.com.my/jom-perlis.php).

To add your own icon, I recommend using the [Firefox OS app icons style guide](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/styleguide/products/firefoxos/icons/).

**Note:** If you use the Add Directory option in the Simulator, make sure to change `"launch_path": "/JomKFC-FirefoxOS/index.php"` to `"launch_path": "index.php"` and the icon paths accordingly since it runs it as a packaged app directly from the root folder of the JomKFC FirefoxOS.

All options to test packaged apps are outlined in the [How to install packaged apps in Firefox OS â€“ options and tools](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/03/how-to-install-packaged-apps-in-firefox-os-options-and-tools/) article/) article
