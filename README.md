## Preview

To test/install this app, download the code and run it on a web server, or navigate to [Firefox OS KFC MY locator](http://amirolahmad.github.com/Firefox-OS-KFC-MY-locator/) in Firefox on a device or in the Firefox OS Simulator. 

Alternatively, install it in the Firefox OS Simulator Dashboard by providing either of these URLs:

* [http://amirolahmad.github.com/Firefox-OS-KFC-MY-locator/](http://amirolahmad.github.com/Firefox-OS-KFC-MY-locator/)
* [http://amirolahmad.github.com/Firefox-OS-KFC-MY-locator/manifest.webapp](http://amirolahmad.github.com/Firefox-OS-KFC-MY-locator/manifest.webapp)

**Note:** If you use the Add Directory option in the Simulator, make sure to change `"launch_path": "/Firefox-OS-KFC-MY-locator/index.php"` to `"launch_path": "index.php"` and the icon paths accordingly since it runs it as a packaged app directly from the root folder of the Firefix OS KFC MY locator.

All options to test packaged apps are outlined in the [How to install packaged apps in Firefox OS â€“ options and tools](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/03/how-to-install-packaged-apps-in-firefox-os-options-and-tools/) article/) article
