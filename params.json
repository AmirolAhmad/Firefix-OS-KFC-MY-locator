{"name":"Firefix OS KFC MY locator","tagline":"Creating Firefox OS Apps - Locate the nearest KFC around user","body":"Firefix OS KFC MY locator\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nCreating Firefox OS Apps - Locate the nearest KFC around user\r\n\r\nThis is a sample app for Firefox OS, loosely based on Web apps, meant to act as a simple html for getting started with apps for Firefox OS.\r\n\r\nTo add your own icon, I recommend using the [Firefox OS app icons style guide](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/styleguide/products/firefoxos/icons/).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Preview\r\n\r\nTo test/install this app, download the code and run it on a web server, or navigate to [Firefix OS KFC MY locator](http://amirolahmad.github.com/Firefix-OS-KFC-MY-locator/) in Firefox on a device or in the Firefox OS Simulator. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, install it in the Firefox OS Simulator Dashboard by providing either of these URLs:\r\n\r\n* [http://amirolahmad.github.com/Firefix-OS-KFC-MY-locator/](http://amirolahmad.github.com/Firefix-OS-KFC-MY-locator/)\r\n* [http://amirolahmad.github.com/Firefix-OS-KFC-MY-locator/manifest.webapp](http://amirolahmad.github.com/Firefix-OS-KFC-MY-locator/manifest.webapp)\r\n\r\n**Note:** If you use the Add Directory option in the Simulator, make sure to change `\"launch_path\": \"/Firefix-OS-KFC-MY-locator/index.html\"` to `\"launch_path\": \"index.html\"` and the icon paths accordingly since it runs it as a packaged app directly from the root folder of the Firefix OS KFC MY locator.\r\n\r\nAll options to test packaged apps are outlined in the [How to install packaged apps in Firefox OS â€“ options and tools](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/03/how-to-install-packaged-apps-in-firefox-os-options-and-tools/) article","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
